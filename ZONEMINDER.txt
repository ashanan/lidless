ZoneMinder Tweaks
----------------

ZoneMinder will somewhat work out of the box with lidless, but not optimally.

## Suggested

* If you aren't running your web browser on the same machine as lidless, you'll need to turn off IP based hashing of session hashes in the ZoneMinder settings.
* For the user who'll be used to access ZoneMinder streams, make sure the quality settings are turned up as high as possible, unless you're in a bandwidth constrained scenario (which you really shouldn't be, as it's advised to run lidless in the same network as ZoneMinder).
