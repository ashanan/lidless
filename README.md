# What's This?

lidless is a program for monitoring a ZoneMinder camera feed and interfacing it to IRC, allowing users to request info on how busy the view captured by the camera is.

* ramirez (https://github.com/eastein/ramirez)
* OpenCV with python support, 2.1 or greater
* CPython 2.6 or greater (other pythons may work as well)
