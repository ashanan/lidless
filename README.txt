# What's This?

lidless is a program for monitoring a ZoneMinder camera feed and interfacing it to IRC, allowing users to request info on how busy the view captured by the camera is.

# Dependencies

* zmstream (https://github.com/eastein/zmstream)
* OpenCV with python support, 2.1 or greater
* CPython 2.6 or greater (other pythons may work as well)
* python-irclib

You'll need a ZoneMinder server for this to be useful, although it may work with motion-jpeg http streams.

# HOWTO

It's best to read the source to understand how to invoke lidless successfully right now, it's very much in a state of flux.
